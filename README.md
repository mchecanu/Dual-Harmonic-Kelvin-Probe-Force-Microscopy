# Dual-Harmonic-Kelvin-Probe-Force-Microscopy

This is the notebook I used for the data analysis of the CNMS User project: "Understanding the electronic interaction at the graphene-electrolyte interface". Main user: Marta Delga, ICN2, Barcelona, Spain.

Structure:
  1. Importing Data
  2. Calculating Contact potential difference (CPD)
  3. Visualizing Data
  4. K-means Clustering
  6. Finding optimal K

Experimental Data Files are abailable upon request.
